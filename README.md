BRML Drivers and Data Recorder
==============================

This repository contains drivers for lab equipment and self-built robots at BRML labs.
It also contains a generic sample recorder class for obtaining time-synchronized samples from arbitrary sensors.

Currently the following hardware is supported:

  * Linmot using the LinRS serial protocol
  * Movtec Wacht xy-table using a Nanotec stepper motor controller
  * Syntouch Biotac sensors using a Cheetah SPI USB adapter

Documentation and sample code is available at https://brml.github.io/BRMLDrivers
